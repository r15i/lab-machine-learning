This deterministic behavior might pose issues when the dataset is presented in a certain order, potentially leading to slow convergence or failure to converge in some situations.\n",

    "In the modified version of the `perceptron()` function, randomization is introduced in the sample selection process. Instead of consistently choosing the first misclassified sample, this version randomly selects a misclassified sample for weight updates. The rationale behind this randomization is to break the deterministic pattern observed in the original perceptron algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Introducing randomness in sample selection helps diversify the sequence of samples considered for updates, potentially mitigating issues related to dataset ordering that could hinder convergence. This randomization aims to make the algorithm more robust and efficient by avoiding specific patterns that might impede convergence in the original perceptron.\n",

    "With more iterations, the perceptron has more opportunities to update its weights and better fit the training data. However, after a certain point, increasing the number of iterations may result in very marginal improvements in precision on the training set and sometimes lead to overfitting (depending on the seed), as indicated by the observed training error. Usually, with the same seed and before overfitting occurs, an increase in the number of iterations tends to decrease and bring closer the training and test errors.\n",
